## stuff I should do to improve this (aka. TODO)

#### goal #1

* actually hook in to the [seizuretracker.com](https://seizuretracker.com/) API!
  - once this is reality, it can actually get sent off to Amazon for certification and hopefully ðŸ¤ž get published as an Alexa Skill for any one to use maybe?

---

#### others

* `class{}`-y PHP would be great.
* [this](https://github.com/ericoc/alexa-testing/blob/master/seizure/seizure.php#L31); where I just accept whatever, if it got a string back
* maybe do more intense checking on phrases received from Alexa?
  - it absolutely cannot do proper voice-to-text on the word *"ended"* no matter how I pronounce it
      * I've gotten back *"and 8"*, *"I ate and"*, and all kinds of crazy stuff that's not even close
  - just waiting may fix this since hopefully Alexa speech-to-text will improve with time
